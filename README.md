libtaxii
--------

Python module for TAXII. 

Update 4/30 - This module is currently out of date. TAXII 1.0 Final will be released later today (4/30/2013), 
and this library is not conformant with TAXII 1.0 Final. Providing developer support is a priority, and libtaxii 
will be updated in the near future. The concepts in this library are expected to 
(for the most part) remain unchanged as the library is updated to conform to TAXII 1.0 Final.
