libtaxii
--------

libtaxii is a Python library for handling TAXII Messages as Python objects and invoking TAXII Services.

## Overview

A primary goal of libtaxii is to remain faithful to both the TAXII specifications 
and to customary Python practices. In places where these conflict, and the goal is 
to make libtaxii intuitive both to Python developers and XML developers.

## Getting Started
Documentation is availale here: https://github.com/TAXIIProject/libtaxii/wiki/Documentation
If your questions is not answered in the documentation (and it very well may not be, documentation is an ongoing process),
you are encouraged to post your question to the TAXII discussion list (http://taxii.mitre.org/community/registration.html).

## Versioning

Releases of libtaxii will be given 'major.minor.revision'
version numbers, where 'major' and 'minor' correspond to the TAXII version
being supported. The 'revision' number is used to indicate new versions of
libtaxii. The revision number is a 3-digit number (e.g., '100') where the first
digit indicates the major revision of libtaxii and the second two digits indicate the
minor revision of libtaxii. For example, 1.0.100 indicates a version of libtaxii that
is conformant with TAXII 1.0, has a major version of 1, and a minor version of 00.
